## PURPOSE
There are three main purposes of this application: 
1. To provide a fun way to learn new things on a wide range of topics. It's been proven that children (and adults) learn better when they are having fun and happy. Therefore, the application is an effort to encourage learning at all ages.  
   
2. To be used as a tool for teaching and assessment. This application is suitable to use in a classroom because its topics can be added, and there is no limits. It is another tool for teachers to make their lessons more interactive and interesting. 
   
3. At the end of the day, the application is a game, so it aims to entertain. The user/player can use it as a light-hearted way to wind down, or tas a challenge to their friends.
